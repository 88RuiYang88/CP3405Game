## Project Introduction

"Guess Who?" is a popular table guessing game played by two players. The goal of the game is to guess the character selected by the opponent by asking various questions about the character's appearance. At the start of the game, each player randomly selects one card from a set of character cards and keeps it secret. The players then take turns asking questions to narrow down the possible choices. For example, you might ask, "Does your character wear glasses?" Based on the answer, you can eliminate certain characters. The players continue to ask questions and eliminate options until they have enough information to guess the opponent's character. The first player to correctly guess the other's character wins the game. "Guess Who?" is not only entertaining but also helps to develop observation and logical reasoning skills. It is suitable for all age groups and is a popular game for families and gatherings. In the game "Guess Who?", each player starts with a board featuring images and names of 28 different characters, and a deck of 28 cards, each depicting one of the characters. Both players randomly draw a card (the character the opponent must guess) and keep it secret. Players then take turns asking yes-or-no questions about the appearance or characteristics of the other player's chosen character, such as "Does your character have red hair?" Based on the answers, they eliminate characters that don't match the description, narrowing down the possibilities until they feel confident enough to make a guess. A correct guess wins the game; an incorrect guess loses. The main objective is to use deductive reasoning to guess the opponent's character before they guess yours, and the game typically takes around 15 to 20 minutes to play, offering a fun exercise in logic and observation for players of all ages.
